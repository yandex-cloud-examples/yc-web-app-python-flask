# Creating a Python web application with Flask in Yandex Cloud

With this tutorial, you will develop a simple web application from scratch: a mini blog where users can create, view, edit, and delete posts. To do this, you will create a [Yandex Compute Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.ru/ru/docs/compute/) VM in Yandex Cloud and run a web server on it.

The web app is written in Python and uses SQLite to work with data. To develop the frontend, we will use Bootstrap.

We opted for Flask as the base framework for our application, since it is one of the most intuitive and straightforward Python web frameworks.

For a step-by-step tutorial, see the relevant [Yandex Cloud documentation](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/tutorials/web/flask).
